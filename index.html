    <h3>Coding during a periode of mess</h3>
    <p>This Year Was a very hard year to all of us and that all because of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Covid-19</a>. It was a horrible year to all of us.</p>
    <p>For me It was an oppurtunity to develop my self and discover what I really want to be in the futur,
     well coding has been always a passion for me since I'm studying computer science but I found where I want to spialize and that was web developement for me I used all the time I had to study my passion but as we know life isn't always easy I had some problems and that pushed me to stop learning and searching, I'm no going to lie I losed myself.</p>
    <p>But I took some time to think and gain motivation and here I am studying with all the energy I have, The message I wanted you to know is that life isn't easy but we don't have that this is the end we must survive we must chase our dreams. <em>What feels like the <strong>end</strong> is always the <strong>beginning</strong></em></p>
    <p>And now I want to share with you some Habits that kept me motivated</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting checklists and goals</li>
        <li>Cleaning your desk well that helped me studying</li>
        <li>Practice at least 2hours a day</li>
        <li>Find programming buddy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I wanted to share with you this passion Maaybe someone will find it helpfull</p>
